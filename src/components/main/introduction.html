        <p>OilSupply is a special project that coordinates putting resources into oil with putting resources into crypto.
        Oil is one of the most hotly debated assets on the market, and as the global demand for energy, plastics and
        other petroleum products continues to surge, so too will demand for this commodity, which is in limited supply.</p>
        <p>
          This new project aims to integrate the tradition and experience of the oil & gas industry with the
          innovativeness of the crypto-world.
