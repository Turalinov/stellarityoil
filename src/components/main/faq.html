            <p>By investing in oil assets, you gain exposure to the oil and gas industry commodity without having to
              directly deal with commodity spot prices. Oil isn’t going anywhere any time soon, and with energy
              consumption at all-time highs, there’s plenty of room for the asset to gain in value.

            <p>The oil and gas industry supports millions of American jobs, provides lower energy costs for consumers,
              and ensures our energy security. The absolute income of the oil business overall is assessed to be
              somewhere in the range of 2% and 3% of worldwide GDP. This gives a thought of how fundamental oil in our
              economies is still. On the other hand, investors may profit from the stability of a well-founded economic
              field like oil exploitation, and from the dynamism and adjustability of the blockchain-supported crypto
              economy.
